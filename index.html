		<h1>Gender, Equality, and Sexuality in Scandinavia</h1>
		<section id="intro">
			<p>This summer, I took a 3 week long course on gender, equality, and sexuality in Scandinavia. I learned a lot of interesting things about how Scandinavia is great, but also how it still has a lot more to improve. The following is what I've learned through pictoral form.</p>

			<p>In Sweden, parents are granted 480 days of parental leave for each child that they have. They can use these days as they wish up until their child is 8 years old. The father is required to take a minimum of 60 days. In the USA, there is <em>no legally mandated minimum parental leave.</em></p>

			<h2>Trans People and Sterilization</h2>

			<p>I was horrified to learn that from 1972 up until 2013, Sweden required that trans people become sterilized before they could attain legal gender recognition. People who were sterilized during this time were later provided compensation of roughly $25,000, but even that seems like not enough when discussing removing someone's ability to procreate. Sweden was also the first country to pay damages to trans victims of forced sterilization. Hopefully fewer countries will have this requirement and those that do will also abolish this requirement.</p>

			<h2>Feminist Porn</h2>
			<p>I had never really heard of feminist porn prior to taking this class. I was aware of the masculine, voyuer perspective that most porn strives for, along with its problematic effects on men's interaction with women (namely they become more violent). The ingredients of a feminist porn are: </p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>I originally came up with this idea when I was comparing the United States' terrible parental leave policy to Sweden’s liberal and helpful one. I find that taking popular culture and mixing it with unrelated facts is a unique and engaging way to share knowledge. Because the viewer already has some familiarity with what I’m referencing, it’s easier to place the conflicting forces (or hypothetical situation) into something they’ve already seen before. By removing the barriers to this information, it’s also easier to understand and process. In an age of content overload, it can be hard to figure out what information to filter out and which deserves our attention. Hopefully, I was able to successfully win your attention.</p>
